# WillametteClimate

## Project Details
This repository is part of a climate data project from Lookout Eugene–Springfield by Ashli Blow and Michael Zhang. The project produces a monthly concise article using rainfall, snowpack, and drought data to track climate conditions in the southern Willamette Valley. This README serves as a guide to standardize how data are collected, processed, and reported for the monthly articles.

- Select county-level data.  
- Use the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DCSI).

The DCSI ranges from 0, indicating no abnormal dryness or drought, to 500, indicating exceptional drought. Values near 250 reflect moderate to severe drought conditions.
